    "Starting new experiments in `PsychoPy` follows the same guidelines as starting new projects in general. This includes the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- create and store everything in a dedicated place on your machine \n",
    "\n",
    "- create and use a dedicated computing environment\n",

    "\n",
    "As addressed during the first weeks of the course, `computing environments` are essential when programming, not only in `Python`.

Lucky for us `Python` makes it easy to `create` and `manage` `computing environments`, for example using [conda]().\n",

Creating a new `directory` is no biggie using `bash`. We can simply use `mkdir` and specify the wanted `path` and `name`. For the sake of simplicity, let's put everything in a folder called `psychopy_experiment` on our `Desktop`s. "

While the transition from `jupyter notebooks` to `python scripts` might seem harsh at first, it‚Äôs actually straight-forward: the steps we conducted/`commands` we `run` in an incremental fashion will also be indicated/`run` in an incremental fashion here, just within one `python script` line-by-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what's the first thing we usually do? That's right: `import`ing `modules` and `function`s we need. Comparably to `jupyter notebook`, we will do that at the beginning of our `script`. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Please note, that we will go through a realistic example of `coding` `experiments` in `python` and thus might not import all `modules`/`functions` we will actually need from the start. Thus, we will add them to the the beginning of our scripts as we go along._\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we come across one of `PsychoPy`‚Äôs core working principles: we need a `general experiment window`, i.e. a place we can display/present something on. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can define a variety of different `windows` based on different `screens`/`monitors` which should however be adapted to the `setup` and `experiment` at hand (e.g. `size`, `background color`, etc.). Basically all `experiments` you will set up will require you to define a `general experiment window` as without it no `visual stimuli` (e.g. `images`, `text`, `movies`, etc.) can be displayed/presented or how `PsychoPy` would say it: `drawn`\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of which: this is the next core working principle we are going to see and explore is the difference between `draw`ing something and showing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Draw`ing & `flip`ping\n",
    "\n",
    "In `PsychoPy` (and many other comparable software) there‚Äôs a big difference between `draw`ing and showing something. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we need to `draw` something on/in a `window`, to actually `add` the `component` to our `window`, that alone won‚Äôt actually show it. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is because `PsychoPy` internally uses `‚Äútwo screens‚Äù` one `background` or `buffer` `screen` which is not seen (yet) and one `front screen` which is (currently) seen. When you `draw` something it‚Äôs always going to be `draw`n on the `background`/`buffer` `screen`, thus ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù and you need to `flip` it to the `front screen` to be ‚Äúvisible‚Äù.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Why does `PsychoPy` (and other comparable software) work like that? The idea/aim is always the same: increase performance and minimize delays (as addressed in the [slides]()). \n",
    "\n",
    "`Draw`ing something might take a long time, depending on the stimulus at hand, but `flip`ping something already drawn from the `buffer` to the `front screen` is fast(er). It can thus ensure better and more precise timing. This can work comparably for `images`, `sounds`, `movies`, etc. where things are set/`draw`n/pre-loaded and presented exactly when needed.  "

    "Believe it or not folks, with that we already created our first working `PsychoPy` `experiment`. Using only a small amount of, _very readable_, `code`, we can obtain `ratings` for our `stimuli`. Obviously, this is a very simple `experiment` but nevertheless a good start, showcasing a lot of the core things you should know to start using `PsychoPy` for `experiments`. All the things addressed here are usually also part of much more complex `experiments`, as well as build their basis. For an overview on how to add to this (e.g. our snacks and animals list) head over to the [slides](https://m-earnest.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2022/experiments/experiments.html) or the [`rating_artists.py`](https://github.com/M-earnest/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2022/blob/main/lecture/experiments/rating_artists.py) script. For an overview on how the same framweork can be used for e.g. a reaction-time task look into the [`flanker_task.py`] script. If you consider using psychopy for your experiments (which you definetly should!) it's always a good idea to check google for possible implementations of experiment ideas close to whatever you're trying to accomplish.\n",
