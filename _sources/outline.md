# General outline
Within this course, we will talk about and work through the core aspects of using `python` for a scientific project, i.e. `data acquisition` and `data analyzes`. 
In order to provide a solid basis for the practical work on these topics, they will be preceded by an in-depth `introduction` that will introduce and outline central characteristics and functions of the `python` programming language.
These three defining parts will also be used as cornerstones of the course outline and will entail respective more-detailed subsections.


### When and where do we meet?

As mentioned in the [overview - adapt link]() section, the course will be held as a blocked seminar. The first meeting on Friday the 28.10.22 from 14.00 (ct?) to 18.00 at the "Seminarhaus" (SH) in room SH 3.105, Theodor-W.-Adorno-Platz 6, 60323, Frankfurt am Main. The following meetings will be held from 10.00 (ct) to 18.00 on the 4.11.22, 5.11.22 and on the 19.11.22 in room SH 3.105.

### Schedule

Please see below for our current optimistic schedule. Depending on our progress, potential problems and different forms of learning, content and times might change a bit. Each lecture will be divided into several parts separated by a 5-10 minute break and might constitute a transition from basic to advanced concepts, theoretic to practical sessions and individual to group work. The different parts are roughly indicated in the schedule below like this:

🗓 - important information on date & time  
💡 - input from the instructor  
👨🏻‍🏫 - instructor presents content  
🥼 - research project work  
🧑🏽‍💻🧑🏾‍💻 - work on demo data  
🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬 - work on own research project  
🖥️ - computational work outside course hours  
✍🏽 - writing outside course hours  
📖 - reading outside course hours  


**Please note** that the optimistic schedule below may be subject of change, dependent on time constraints and progress made in the previous meetings.
