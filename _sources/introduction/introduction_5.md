# Introduction V

Within the fifth session we'll continue to explore `jupyter notebooks` as a central tool, resource and prerequisite for future endeavors as all of the `introduction to python`, as well as `data analyzes part` will be conducted within them.  Subsequently, we start working with the `python` programming language, as well as situate and compare it to other programming languages. However, before we get back to programming we need to address the elephant in the `virtual room`.

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.


### Introduction to Python - I
The big moment is finally here: after spending quite a bit of time exploring important concepts adjacent to/around `python`, with the intention to provide a holistic understanding and situate components accordingly, we will start exploring `python` itself. Within the first block of programming with `python` we will go through basics of the `python` programming language, its central aspects and building blocks, as well as its benefits generally speaking and within the context of psychology research.

#### Objectives 📍

- learn basic and efficient usage of the python programming language
  - what is python & how to utilize it
  - building blocks of & operations in python
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

#### Materials 📓

Please see the rendered version of the `jupyter notebook` [Introduction V - Introduction to Python I](https://m-earnest.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2022/introduction/intro_python_I.html) in the `ToC` on the left.

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

Your third homework assignment will entail working through a few tasks covering the contents discussed in this session within of a `jupyter notebook`. You can download it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DTO2ufmm6u6OCYIw5M9qaDaJt94fMA7i/view?usp=share_link). In order to open it, put the `homework assignment notebook` within the folder you stored the `course materials`, start a `jupyter notebook` as during the sessions, navigate to the `homework assignment notebook`, open it and have fun!
