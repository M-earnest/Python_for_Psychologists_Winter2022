    "Ahoi hoi folks and welcome to homework assignment `#5` of the \"Python for Psychologists\" course, winter term 2022. Within this homework assignment you'll finih up with the `python` lessons. Again, if you encounter any problems along the way, please don't hesitate to get in touch or check back in the [`Introduction to Jupyter`](https://m-earnest.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2022/introduction/introduction_4.html)  or the [`Intro to Python III`](https://m-earnest.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2022/introduction/introduction_6.html) chapters on the course website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some general points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the assignment you will be asked to either provide some `answers to questions in written form` or directly `code`. Regarding the first, you can just write your answer in the empty `markdown cells` below the questions. Regarding the second, you can write your `code` in the empty `code cells` below the questions and actually `run` it so that the output (if there's one) will be included in the notebook. The `number` and `type` of `cell` you need to answer a given questions will be indicated but if you want to use more `cells` please don't hesitate to add a few. If you see something like \"Type Markdown ... or Please provide your solution here\n",
    "\", you can just click (or double-click) on it to make it a `markdown cell`. If any of this sounds confusing or unclear you can again consult the [`Introduction to Jupyter`](https://m-earnest.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2022/introduction/introduction_4.html) page. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please don't forget to save your `notebook` regularly (maybe every few minutes) either via `strg + s` on `windows` and `cmd + s` on `macOS`. Once you finished the `assignment`, pleas save the entire `notebook` via `File` -> `Save as...` and provide the following name `FirstNameSurname_pfp_2022_homework_assignment_5` where `FirstName` should be changed to your first name and `Surname` to your surname.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this homework assignment is to go through the things we talked about in the session again and deepen your understanding of them. This will entail the following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1. Control Flow operations]()  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[a. if-else]()  \n",

    "[2. Functions]()  \n",
    "[3. Outro/Q&A]()    \n",
    "\n",
    "If some of the things asked here were actually not (sufficiently) covered during the session, please let me know. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, I hope you have a great time and that you view this as less like an assignment and more like a fun add on to the session. Remember: Be a mover! Learning new things takes time and frustrations can't always be avoided. If you can't figure something out it's best to take some time off, do something enjoyable for a while and come back with a fresh mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again you putting in the effort is already fantastic and what really matters!\n",
